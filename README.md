# TrivialIntegrationTestWebService [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/jorgeb1980/TrivialIntegrationTestWebService.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jorgeb1980/TrivialIntegrationTestWebService/builds/latest)
=======================

This project implements a trivial example of a web service with separate unit and integration tests.  

This means that, depending on the maven profile chosen to run, it will run some unit tests on a class
or it will pop up a jetty server and will query the exposed REST API.

Only for self-educational purposes, just an example to start with :)
